# Pygame Ping Pong Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of a ping pong game using the Pygame library in Python.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
3. Run the script
   ```bash
   python pingpong.py

## Game Controls
Left Paddle:
Move Up: W key
Move Down: S key
Right Paddle:
Move Up: Up arrow key
Move Down: Down arrow key

## Game Rules
The game is a classic ping pong match between two players.
Each player controls a paddle on their side of the screen.
The objective is to hit the ball with the paddle and score points.
The game continues until one of the players reaches the winning score.
The winning score is set to 10 by default but can be changed by modifying the winningscore variable in the code.
Game Features
The game features a simple user interface with paddles, a ball, and a score display.
Paddles can be moved up and down using specified keys.
The ball bounces off the paddles and walls, and scores are updated accordingly.
The game announces the winner when either player reaches the winning score.
After a victory, the game resets, allowing for a new match to begin.

## Acknowledgements
This rendition of ping pong would not have been possible without the Pygame module, as well as this super awesome tutorial I was able to follow and draw my inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGTZlnnX3U .
